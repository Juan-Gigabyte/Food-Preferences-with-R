# Food preferences from around the world

- - - -

A data visualization project using a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vijayashreer/food-preferences) that has the food preferences of people from around the world. I will be using R as my language of choice for this project.

## Goals for the project

- - - -

My main focus for this project is answering the following questions:

* Does there exist a bias for traditional food? 
* Does age affect this bias?
* Does their food preference affect their drink of choice?
* Does their food preference affect whether they eat dessert?

To answer these questions I will conduct a qualitative analysis on the questionnaire, using data visualization to help demonstrate my points.
