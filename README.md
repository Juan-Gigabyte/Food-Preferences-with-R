# Food preferences from around the world

- - - -

A data visualization project using a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vijayashreer/food-preferences) that has the food preferences of people from around the world. I will be using R as my language of choice for this project.

## Goals for the project

- - - -

My main focus for this project is answering the following questions:

* Is there a preference for Western food or Traditional food?
* Why is there a preference?
* Does age affect this preference?
* Does their food preference affect their drink of choice?
* Does their food preference affect whether they eat dessert?

To answer these questions I will conduct a qualitative analysis on the questionnaire, using data visualization to help demonstrate my points.

## My Findings

- - - -

After conducting my analysis I can say for certain that people from all age groups mostly women do in fact prefer traditional food.

People who eat western food also seem to lead a more unhealthy life style as they opt to drink carbonated drinks and eat dessert afterwards. However as people age the preference for western food decreases.
